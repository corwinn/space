What is it?
===========

A "more-colors" remake of "kspace.kss" - a "KDE" 3.5.10 screensaver.


Why?
====

Because one day "KDE" 3.5.10 will become either not build-able or not run-able
and/or people will leave "kspace.kss" unmaintained, etc., and I really like what
it does. But mostly because things like "kspace.kss" should be short and simple,
and certainly not dependable on enormous frameworks like "KDE" and its primary
dependency.


What will it become?
====================

More believable space flight simulator I hope (with impossible speeds of course,
because as you all probably know, the distances between the known stars are
immense; or should I say the distances are improbable?)


Keyboard keys
=============

 * 'q' - quits the program
 * 'f' - toggle full-screen
 * 'p' - pause/resume the animation (debug purposes mostly)


How to build
============

 * *nix:
     - clang: type "Make"
     - others: "cat Makefile" and figure it out :) TODO
 * x86_64-w64-mingw32-clang++: type ". build_it_mingw"
 * "VS": TODO (create dev. env. with "FreeGLUT-3.4.0"; should compile and run as
               expected, but one can't be sure until it does)


Credits
=======

Thanks to:

  * "KDE" 3.5.10 "kspace.kss" - for the insipration.
  * "FreeGLUT-3.4.0" for the, windowing system to "Open GL", bridge.
  * "MinGW-w64-9.0.0" for the means of cross-compiling the "Windows" OS binary.
